# DSA Journey

This repository documents my daily study of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Goal
Build a strong foundation in problem solving, data structures, and algorithms through consistent daily practice and documentation.

## Structure
- `arrays/` → problems, notes, and patterns related to arrays
- `mistakes.md` → common mistakes and lessons learned
- Each folder contains:
  - problem solutions
  - `notes.md` with key patterns and insights

## Method
- Study one topic per day
- Solve problems independently
- Document patterns and mistakes
- Commit progress daily

## Progress
- Day 1: Arrays — Two Sum
