# DSA Journey

This repository documents my daily study of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Goal
Build a strong foundation in problem solving, data structures, and algorithms through consistent daily practice and documentation.

## Structure
- `arrays/` → problems, notes, and patterns related to arrays
- `mistakes.md` → common mistakes and lessons learned
- Each folder contains:
  - problem solutions
  - `notes.md` with key patterns and insights

## Method
- Study one topic per day
- Solve problems independently
- Document patterns and mistakes
- Commit progress daily

## Progress
- Day 1: Arrays - Two Sum
- Day 2: Arrays - Prefix Sum
- Day 3: Arrays - Kadane (Maximum Subarray)
- Day 4: Binary Search
- Day 5: Arrays e Linked Lists
- Day 6: Selection Sort
- Day 7: Recusion & Call Stack
- Day 8: Quick Sort
- Day 9: Hash Tables (Concept)
- Day 10: Hash Tables (Pratice)
